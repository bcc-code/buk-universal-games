Climbing a Ferris wheel can be challenging, and it's crucial to remember the importance of carrying first aid supplies. Please get your team to reach the other side and rescue these helpless individuals in need.",
    "nerve_spiral": "As you patiently await your turn in line for the next ride, suddenly there is an event of a power failure, there's no need to panic. Can your team skilfully navigate through this unexpected situation, safely departing from the line without experiencing any electrical shocks? Stay calm and trust in your team's ability to handle this challenge with composure and grace. ",
    "ticket_twist": "People are waiting in line to get their ticket. Is your team capable of handling the speed and stress that comes at the ticket booth. This game combines quick thinking, endurance, speed and teamwork. Stay focused and flip as many tickets to your team color. Are you ready for the challenge?",

    "monkey_bars": "Player one starts climbing the Monkey Bars as far as they can. Once they have reached the 12th bar, the next player can start from the beginning.\n\nExample: Player one has touched the 26th bar last, so his score will be 26 points. Player two fell at the 18th bar, so her score is 18 points. The points of all the players will be added up and divided by the total number of players in the team. That will be your teams' total points.",
    "nerve_spiral": "When the start signal sounds, the first two players can go to the spiral, both take one side of the metal ring and try to get to the first checkpoint without touching the tube.\n\n When the two players get to one checkpoint, they go back and two new players enter the game. When these two players touch the spiral, they go back to the team and two new players continue from the last checkpoint. You continue until you reach the end of the spiral. The team that finishes first wins.",
    "ticket_twist": "For this game, every player that participates in the game, needs to wear a ribbon of his or her team's color. 10 players of each team will compete against each other in the field. The goal of this game is to flip as many tiles as possible to your team's color. The players in the field can switch as often as they want, but then the new player needs the ribbon from the 'old' player and then the new player can continue with the game. The game consists of 1 round of 8 minutes. When the time is up, all players leave the field and the tiles will be counted by color. The team that flipped the most tiles to their color, wins the game.",
    "mine_field": "This game will take place in a big field with small sections. Each team has two captains on the sidelines guiding the player without using phones or any other aid. Player one starts and tries to go through the field without stepping in a wrong box. To know if you're in a right or wrong box, you use the beeper in each box. When the beeper gives the alarm signal, you're in the wrong box and you have to switch the player for a new player. Each player checks each box, even though it is 100% certain it is not a mine. The captains help with remembering the right pathway. You go on until you've reached the finish and then your time will stop. The team with the fastest time, wins the game.",
    "table_surfing": "The goal of this game is to get one person to the other side of the track on the flamingo over rolling persons. With your team you need to take several turns and try to not let the person on top fall on the ground. At the end of the track, you'll find a slope. Once the boys have climbed the slope, the bell rings and you switch teams. The second team (girls) will lay out the same track on the way back, with going down the slope and around all the curves. The team that crosses the finish line first, wins."
