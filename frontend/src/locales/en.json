    "iron_grip": "In the competition 'Iron Grip,' nine participants face each other in a challenge where the goal is to hang from a scaffold for as long as possible within a ten-minute period. All participants start hanging at the same time, with their palms facing forward, when the countdown begins. \n\nA judge, referred to as judge (a), is responsible for stopping and starting the clock. The clock stops when all nine participants are in place and hanging from the scaffold, and it starts again each time someone lets go. Another judge, judge (b), monitors the total ten-minute time available to the participants. \n\nParticipants can switch with teammates waiting nearby, ready to climb up the ladder and take over. There are no restrictions on the number of switches or how many times a participant can hang. The competition is about accumulating the most time hanging from the scaffold within the given ten-minute timeframe.",
    "land_water_beach": "This post is a reaction post where teams compete against each other. Ten participants from each team start in the zone in the middle.\nIn this challenge, the team where all 10 participants move to the correct zone the fastest earns one point. If reaction times are the same, both teams earn one point. It is therefore crucial to react quickly and move to the correct zone. Incorrect movements result in the other team getting one point. After three signals, the ten participants are replaced by ten new participants from the team. This is repeated over three rounds.\nReaction time is crucial to win.",
    "mastermind": "The post is inspired by the concept of the game Mastermind.\n\nThe team must solve a color code hidden in a box. Five participants are designated as Codebreakers, while the rest of the team acts as color pieces.\n\nCodebreakers place their solutions on the game board, then contact the judge. The judge places 'answer pegs' in the box next to each row. These pegs show how many colors are the correct color and correctly placed (red) and how many colors are the correct color but not correctly placed (white) in the Codebreakers' proposal.",
    "labyrinth": "In this post, the team will be challenged to cooperate by navigating a ball through a labyrinth on a plate.\nThe judge starts the game by placing the ball at the starting point and starting the timer. There are three checkpoints on the board, and all players switch places with new 12 players at each checkpoint, so a total of 36 people get to play.\nWhen the labyrinth is completed or time runs out, the participants calmly place the board on the ground.",
    "hamster_wheel": "In this post, 2 teams compete against each other in their respective “Hamster Wheels”. The team that is fastest through the course without stepping outside the wheel wins. One round is played, but all participants are replaced after 1 round. The first team to finish after 2 rounds wins. The time the teams use will also count towards the points they earn at the post."
